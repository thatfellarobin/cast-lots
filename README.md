# cast-lots
This module allows you to cast lots, where the lots are ASCII sticks.
Interpretation, however, is up for interpretation.

## Usage
`from lots import Lots`

Initialize the Lots class with a certain number of lots (default 10, positive integers only)

`my_cast = Lots(20)`

Cast the lots with `Lots.cast()`
